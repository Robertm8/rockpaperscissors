Rock / Paper / Scissors League Project

This is my first attempt at a basic program of my own creation, and also my first attempt at using GitHub.

Please attempt to branch this program and make changes. Commit those changes and then attempt a pull request! This can be a community project to learn how to use GitHub!

To get started, try making a branch or fork of league.py
